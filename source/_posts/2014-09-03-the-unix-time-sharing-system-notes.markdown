### The File System
From the user's point of view, three kinds of files:

1. **ordinary disk files** - no particular structure expected by system. Structure of files is controlled by programs (object files generated by assembler). Could be binary files or simple text files.
2. **directories** - mapping between the names of files and the files themselves.
    * System maintains several directories for its own use.
      - **root directory**: the starting point for other files in the system.
      - directory that contains commands to be executed. (not required, for convinience since commands can be placed anywhere).
      - null filename refers to current directory.
    * A non-directory file may appear in several other directories under different names. - **linking**
      - A directory entry for this file is called a **link**
      - **Hard Links**: `ln file1 file2` - file2 now links to file1. Both file1 and file2 have same status. File doesn't exist in any directory in general, the directory entry contains link between filename and a pointer to the information describing the file.
    * Each directory has atleast two enteries with name '.' and '..' referring to current and parent directories resp.
    * The directory structure is constrained to have a rooted tree structure.
    * Cycles are not allowed in the file system. However Kernel mainains two restricted types of cycles in each directory: `.` and `..`
3. special files.
